ChangeLog
=========

# Upcoming
* [Help] More than 100-150 new help patches, Every single node except Kinect2 (and experimental) now has a help patch.
* [Bullet] Large redesign of the whole system, many more nodes, clearer API. Soft bodies are not back yet, but constraints + vehicle + filters are there.
* [Build] Now all components are in various subfolders, to make it easier to search and pick and mix. 
* [Build] Lite pack version, without vlc/kinect (which are taking most of the space). So if you don't need those you can use lite pack and save on your precious ssd space (and download times)

* [Build] Now we use warning as errors, build will fail otherwise.
* [Build] Help patch for every node is also enforced by build system which reports errors ifhelp patch is missing.
* [Kinect2] All dependencies are properly copied
* [Nodes] Renderer has option to disable default shortcuts when focused
* [Core] Add READONLYDEPTHTEXTURE semantic, so can rebind a depth buffer as read
* [Nodes] Volume renderer was throwing an error on delete/exit if it was never used
* [Nodes] BufferData, fix stream position reset (which was causing readback to fail in some cases)
* [Nodes] VertexIndirect : fix cast issue which was causing it to fail with some geometries
* [Nodes] Anisotropic sampler node clamps value from 0->16 (enforces it and adds it on ui)
* [Nodes] Multi slice validator was broken, now it's working again.
* [Nodes] unzip text style had wrong data type
* [DirectWrite] Text layout nodes set a ui minimum value for maxwidth/mxheight, and enforce a >= 0 to avoid invalid argument error
* [Nodes] Line Strip now has adjacency option (to build line adj instead)
* [Nodes] Add GetSpread (DX11.Layer Order), allows to get spread a layer, this is much faster than using a validator counterpart.
* [Nodes] Bezier patch helpers on non uniform control points were displaying incorrectly.
* [Nodes] PixelBillBoard and ViewportBillBoard (DX11.Layer) are now spreadable
* [Core]  Gsfx technique change was set back to false too early, which caused shader to be invalid in some cases while authoring.
* [Nodes] SetSlice (TextureArray) now outputs individual slices as well as single TextureArray
* [Core] Fixe some issues that were occuring while generating nodelist (user:azeno)
* [Text] Text library is replaced by a pure c# counterpart, which avoids to require any of the visual c++ toolchains to build the pack (and the correct visual studio version that goes with it)
* [Nodes] FromSharedTexture disposes old handle properly, and handles Nil input properly if it occurs
* [Nodes] Info (DX11.Texture2D) has a pin with creation time (debug timestamp provided by the driver)
* [Nodes] ViewportRouter (DX11.Layer) Some group that sends layer on a per viewport basis
* [Core] Image shader size defaults are hidden and not collapsed now, since they are frequently used for sources
* [Nodes] Text nodes support validators (except frustum test)
* [Nodes] Renderer (DX11.StreamOut) was not releasing buffer properly.
* [Nodes] Renderer (DX11.StreamOut Advanced) new node.
* [Nodes] AsTexture (DX11.Texture 2d Raw) Create texture from a stream (use data as it is, and user needs to provide format/size/stride). Also allows to read from specific location in the stream.

# 1.0.1
* [Nodes] Fixed last minute issue in DynamicBuffer 
* [Deployment] Sorted Kinect2 missing libraries.

# 1.0.0 (Release 06/02/2017)
* [Girlpower] Many new help patches and examples.
* [Core]  Renderer nodes now have a WriteOnly depth mode (in case depth is not needed for reading, this is the recommended mode)
* [Nodes] Dynamicbuffers now have different upload option (Dynamic/Default/Immutable)
* [Nodes] InputElement (DX11.Geometry Preset) new node (bunch of commonly used presets in an enum to avoid InputElement join boilerplate)
* [Nodes] Vlc node reports file as invalid if they are parsing late, instead of ptotential crash.
* [Nodes] TextSettings (DX11.Advanded) Allows to create a different text engine, can be provide to text nodes (this allows larger glyph texture sizes for example, to bypass the 512 limit).
* [Nodes] Readback structured buffer nodes can now read any structured buffer.
* [Nodes] new node BufferData (DX11.RawBuffer) : gets raw buffer data as a stream.
* [Nodes] DispatcherX DispatcherXY (DX11.Drawer) convenience nodes for 1d/2d dispatch, which does thread group calculations (avoid to replicate this everywhere)
* [Nodes] New node DynamicBuffer (DX11.Buffer Raw) : Dynamic raw buffer from stream
* [Nodes] New node PixelData (DX11.Texture), reads raw pixel data in a stream (does not convert to image format)
* [Nodes] Kinect2 (Devices) has Depth Camera Intrinsics pin (user:id144)
* [Nodes] Add TextFormat(DirectWrite.Advanced)
* [Nodes] new Enabled (DX11.Layer) : Blocks render and evaluate if disabled (same as group does but lightweight version)
* [Nodes] Renderer (DX11) : Now accepts key presses again (was removed due to some old beep issue in 4v)  (user: azeno)
* [Build] Build and deployments are now automated, so release cycle for alpha (on Git Release) is much more frequent
* [Nodes] Add Anisotropic (DX11 Sampler) node
* [Nodes] ViewProjection (DX11.Layer) is now spreadable, allows to fully repeat a layer with different view/projection settings.
* [Nodes] Add World (DX11.Layer). Allows to move a whole layer independently of the camera. Shader can access it via WORLDLAYER semantic (WORLDLAYERINVERSE, WORLDLAYERVIEW, WORLDLAYERVIEWPROJECTION are also added for convenience)
* [Nodes] Standard (eg: All Layer shaders) large performance improvements (better caching and runtime calls),and much more GC friendly.
* [Nodes] Standard (eg: All Layer shaders) have some optimisation if rendering a single geometry several times.
* [Nodes] VideoIn (DX11.DShow) : Fix potential error on delete.
* [Nodes] GetSlice (DX11.TextureArray) and GetSlice (DX11.DepthTextureArray) , fix potential error on delete.
* [Nodes] All platonic solid : Isocahedron, Octahedron, Tetrahedron have a radius parameter.
* [Nodes] Renderer (DX11) now has a Flip Sequential option, which should help in case of tearing.
* [Core] Better caching of interfaces, and better registration for windows (eg: improved performances)
* [Core+Nodes] All parts of the pack are now using IDX11RendererHost, IDX11LayerHost, IDX11ResourceHost instead of provider. This removes IPluginIO as parameter, which creates some issues in many scenarios (just for even being there). Old provider are still there and working alongside but marked as obsolete (and will be removed in next release). Layer version could not run alongside and has been removed. This will need a recompile if a plugin is a custom layer node.
* [Core] Effect pass can now have topology annotation, in order to force a shader to use a specific topology (This is particularily useful for point sprites (which expect points), or tesselation shaders (which expects a fix control point topology), and avoid to have user guess with topology node.
* [Nodes] new Zip (TextStyle) and bin version. (user: sebl)
* [Nodes] Text styles were not spreadable properly. (user: sebl)
* [Nodes] Fix Cylinder (DX11.Geometry) radius issue
* [Nodes] Info (Assimp.Mesh) Fix spread indexing.
* [Nodes] Add Viewport (DX11.Layer Indexed) Set a new viewport depending on camera index from renderer
* [Nodes] Layer nodes are now consistent in behavior. If not enabled they do not apply their eventual change, but still render upstream.
* [Core] Add Tag (DX11.RenderState) node. For advanced usage, allows to attach an object to a state (for custom validator usage for example)
* [Core] All Depth formats are now working (64 bits version was not (even if rarely used)
* [Nodes] Add Text (DX11.Geometry)
* [Nodes] Add Renderer (DX11 TextureSpread), allows to render to multiple textures (not texture array, real spread of texture, size/format can be different)
* [Core] Standard shaders now support multi pass, with the following 2 restrictions: Vertex Input signatur must be the same on all passes (runtime with not validate other passes nor check for equality), and runtime does not reset stages (so make sure to set optional stages to 0).
* [Core] Render states and object settings can now share a Tag node
* [Nodes] Add Tag (DX11.RenderState) node
